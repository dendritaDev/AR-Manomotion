# AR Gesture-Controlled Experiences with ManoMotion SDK
This repository includes four mini-projects that blend the physical and digital worlds through gesture recognition and object manipulation.

## Projects Overview
**Object Interaction:** Two projects focused on using ManoMotion's gesture identification to spawn virtual objects that users can grab and move around, offering an interactive AR experience.
**Virtual Try-On:** Two projects leveraging ManoMotion's tracking capabilities to allow users to virtually try on watches and rings, which adjust to the user's hand position and rotation for a realistic fitting experience.

## Key Features
- Advanced gesture recognition for interactive object manipulation.
- Real-time tracking for accurate virtual try-on experiences.
- Seamless integration of virtual items with real-world hand movements.
